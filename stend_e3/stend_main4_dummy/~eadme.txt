main4_dummy
============   important info =======================
!!! don't make pcb from main4_dummy! !!!

before create pcb for main5,
1. create copy from main4_dummy to main5
2. in main5 remove fujitsu relay  pages for signal and for power.
3. annotate main5
4.create main5 PCB

PCB project need correction on F.Silk – 2S1815 has properly wiring, but pin designators are interchanged. 
And need to change   the  letter K for collector to letter C
Must be changed 
to my new DUAL  footprints -v  or -hor (check which is the better) 

31 october 2021
dummy is schematic for real board and for my own dummy (on the breadboard)

so, it will have wiring table to improve ready PCB (main3)

for issue next generation must create new PCB (main5) with wiring improvements.

And need to check, will it possible direct relay control from shift registers directly, w/o transistors sc1815 and diode 1n4148? 


10 of sep 2021
created optocoupler in schematic 

MCU sheet
17sep2021
add p7 with fujitsu relay a5w-k
add resistors for display data lines 56 kom to +5v
16sep2021
start new version for breadboard dummy
this will be for program testing 
start to assembly from 17sep2021 at first without relays, register +leds only
main3_stencil
final version for stencil
not for far development.
in this version removed dip footprints for sthensils

main3
no edit more - will made main4 for next development
14 sep finished
Place top and bottom and breadboard footprints
and was sent to manufacturing
try 2 replicate chips letters and remove tracks remains
remove letter overlaps

in main2
11/09/21
bus on PCB back annotated
routed all  nets


10sep2021

need to insert photocouplers fo MCU in and out.
09/sep/2021
 
1.made replication layout.
2.routed 1 register. routed MCU power control. and mcu and register connections
in main1 
was made  pcp update


Change symbol X? from 'my_Library:B5B-XH-A' to 'my_Library:B5B-XH-A': OK
